This repo will eventually contain my code written for CS 572 Linux Device
Drivers at PSU. This should include:

The .config used to configure and build the 2.6.24 kernel.
A hello world loadable module.
A block device driver.
A USB device driver for some device which will be built using a teensy.

All code is GPLv2 and I may even add a license file at some point.
